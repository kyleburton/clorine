Factor out the DBCP implementation so we can support other connection pooling implementations, eg:

    https://github.com/swaldman/c3p0


BUG: Clorine allows you to nest with-connection's for the same connection name.
If you nest in the following way:

  (with-connection :foo
    ...
    (with-connection :bar
      ...
      (with-connection :foo
        ..)))

The inner most with-connection should give back a :foo connection, the BUG
causes it to give back a :bar connection.


Connection Validation and Eviction
    See: http://commons.apache.org/dbcp/configuration.html
  Support sensible defaults for the configuration paramters listed 
  Allow all of those configuration parameters to be set when registering
    a connection pool.
